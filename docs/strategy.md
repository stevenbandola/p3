### Host events
Events will have a startsAt and endsAt which will fix the maximum cost with the max tickets sold
This way, we can directly control the income vs the cost and predict allocation of funds to development
E.g a loan based off predicted growth with insurance 

We can use members computers to host sessions of an event
  - Server hosting application
    - Performance analysis
    - Income structure
    - Settings control

Users can "rent" a server and host a session

Sessions can be an instance of a "streaming event" or a single session

Sessions have a map

Maps contain assets, effects
  Assets

  Scripts
    Scripts contain custom logic for creating unique experiences 
    Scripts can be created using an in game interface
    Scripts can manipulate the game world via the engine api
    The engine api contains endpoints for manipulating assets and players
    


Friends made during a session are saved to the player

Friends can be sent an invitation to a current session

Users can attach a recording of themselves (with or without video)

Recordings can use a camera which can be configured to follow, be static, or move in a predetermined path while the recording is playing
